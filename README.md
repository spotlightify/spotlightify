## About The Project

Spotlightify is a GUI based application designed to allow users to quickly interact with Spotify playback
across Windows, Linux and macOS. Created with simplicity and efficiency in mind, Spotlightify allows users to
seamlessly control their music experience without having to navigate through Spotify's native interface.
